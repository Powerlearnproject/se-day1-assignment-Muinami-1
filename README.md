# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools for the development and maintenance of high quality software systems involving design,development,testing,deployment and maintenance of software systems.
It enables development of operating systems;Windows,web applications;facebook,mobile apps;instagram that make modern life easier in areas such as communication,entertainment,commerce and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages,Fortran,C
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in 1960s
The beginning of structured programming in 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies in 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design-creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architechture and user interface
Implementation-writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
Testing-carrying out various tests to ensure the system meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment-releasing the software to users and customers
Maintenance-providing ongoing support,updates and enhancement to the software after deployment
 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall involves sequential approach with distinct phases while agile involves iterative and incremental approach.
Agile methodologies are focused on flexibility,collaboration and responding to change.Waterfall methodologies are low on flexibility.
Agile methodologies in development and maintenance of Instagram
Waterfall methodologies in creation of software to run cars

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer-writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer-ensuring software quality by designing and executing tests plans
Project Manager-oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code.VCS help in tracking change to source code and coordinating work among team members.
IDEs-Visual studio,Eclipse
VCS-Git,Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers face changing requirements,tight deadlines and technical debt.
This can be overcome through effective communicatin,agile methodologies,prioritisation of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-testing individual components or modules of software
Integration testing-testing interaction between different components or subsystems
Acceptance testing-testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
crafting statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
It is important in improving interaction between human and AI and providing the user with an accurate output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An article on a philosopher.
An article on Pericles and his involvement in Athenian politics.
The prompt specifies the philosopher of interest-Pericles
The prompt focuses on a particular area involving Pericles-Athenian politics
